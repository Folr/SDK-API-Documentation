The Folr API allows application developers to harness the power of Folr's location tracking functionality directly in their own smarphone apps.

Smartphone applications can track the device's location simply through the inclusion of the Folr SDK in the application project.

# About Folr Android and iOS SDK

The Folr Android and iOS SDKs allow app developers to include location tracking functionality in their own apps with just a few lines of code. 

All logged locations are automatically stored in the Folr cloud repository, and can be viewed either in the web dashboard, or via the Folr API.
