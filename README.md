# About Folr Business API

The Folr API allows application developers to harness the power of Folr's location tracking functionality in their own smarphone apps and applications.

Users' locations can be tracked (using the Folr Android and iOS SDK, or using your own tracking technology), and then saved to the Folr cloud datastore, and retrieved for reporting purposes.

#About Folr Android SDK

The Folr Android SDK allows app developers to include location tracking functionality in their own apps with just a few lines of code. 

All logged locations are automatically stored in the Folr cloud repository, and can be viewed either in the web dashboard, or via the Folr API.
